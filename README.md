# Functional Generic CSV Writer

An example showing how to use function programming and generics to write a dynamic CSV writer that takes a list of any objects as a parameter and exports such list in CSV format.
The project enables the user to define which columns to be included in the generated CSV. It accepts Functions as parameters to indicate how to get the value to be outputed for each column.
